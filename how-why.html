            <h1>Mental health in the midst of the pandemic</h1>
            <p>The COVID-19 epidemic has had a wide range of effects on us, affecting everything from our social lives to our mental health in some way. Social resistance has also been more widely reported in the media. The epidemic, combined with the rise in social unrest, can be stressful for anybody, but it's critical to recognize how these current events affect communities of color differently.</p>

Additionally, a larger percentage of multi-racial and non-Hispanic adults of other races and ethnicities reported stress and worry about stigma or discrimination associated with being blamed for spreading COVID-19 in comparison to White adults. Among adults with mental illness, 48% of White Americans received mental health services, compared to 31% of Black Americans and Latinx/Hispanic Americans and 22% of AAPI populations"(1).</p>

Figure 1 shows that, low-income households within each racial/ethnic group experience more anxiety than the higher income group.This is a direct result of people of color, women, and low- and middle-income households bearing the pandemic's brunt in their roles as essential workers with poorer health and access to health care. Except for non-Hispanic Asian people, over 40 percent of individuals from households earning less than $25,000 per year, suffer from anxiety shown in Figure 1). Lower-income results in many challenges in accessing technology to utilize mental health resources via telemedicine or wifi to search for resources.Though income plays a large part, it is not the only factor and that shows in figure 2. Non-Hispanic Black and Latinx people experience more anxiety at all levels of income(2). Consequences of poor mental health include lack of productivity in school and the workplace, both today and, more importantly, the future. The unfortunate reality is that if this continues to go unaddressed these crisis-level rates could translate into an increase in "deaths of despair" which will have immediate, short-, and long-term consequences on economic growth(1).</p>
