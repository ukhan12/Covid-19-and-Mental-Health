            <p> There are significant historical, structural, and interpersonal factors that cause mental health disparities by race. We designed this webpage to educate people on the importance of mental health and to provide support and ressources to those in need.</p>
            <h4>Your feelings are valid despite what others may tell you. Take the time to recognize what your stress level is and manage it in a healthy and balanced way.</h4>
